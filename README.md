# GIF viewer
### Description
This is a basic gif viewer that allows you to add categories of gifs to search
and the ability to puase/animate the gifs, once they're loaded.
* goals: play around with __ajax__ and the __giphy api__

* Please note, while I understand I must post this project to my portfolio to
receive full credit, I am currently trying to get my portfolio in a finished form
and am thus trying to keep it clutter free,
